### Using the `CallManager`

The `\KattSoftware\Telephonify\CallManager` allows you to modify an existing call (i.e. start executing another controller's code and stop the current execution - e.g. while playing an audio file in an infinite loop) and to create an outgoing call (i.e. one of your numbers that you bought from your provider to call an external number, such as one of your customers).





Next, you will learn about call events.
